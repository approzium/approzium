# Python SDK

Our Python SDK is designed to easily integrate into existing the database drivers workflow. All you have to do is use the `connect` method it provides. For example, if you are using Psycopg2, all you have to do to adopt Approzium into your client code base is:

```diff
-from psycopg2 import connect
+from approzium.psycopg2 import connect
+from approzium import AuthClient

-conn = connect(password=verySecurePassword", ...)
+conn = connect(authenticator=AuthClient("authenticator:6001") ...)
```

Our Python SDK is designed to pull identity from your local environment. It currently supports:

  - Pulling an assumed role ARN from AWS EC2 instances that have been launched into a role.
  - Pulling an assumed role ARN from AWS Lambda functions that have been launched into an execution role.
  - Pulling a role arn from a local development environment where "`$ aws configure`" has been run.

It uses the well-known `boto3` library for pulling identity, and thus its behavior for parsing identity
is exactly the same.
