```python

from approzium.psycopg2 import connect

# create an Authenticator client
auth = Authenticator('authenticator:6000')

# connect using Approzium's connect method
conn = connect("", authenticator=auth)

# use the connection cas you typically would. very cool!
cur = conn.cursor()
cur.execute('SELECT 1')
