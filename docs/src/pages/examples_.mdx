# Examples

```python
# pg2_client.py

from approzium import AuthClient
from approzium.psycopg2 import connect

# create an Authenticator client
auth = AuthClient('authenticator:6000')

# connect using Approzium's connect method
conn = connect(host=myawesomehost.com, dbname="db", authenticator=auth)

# use the connection object as you typically would. very cool!
cur = conn.cursor()
cur.execute('SELECT 1')
```
