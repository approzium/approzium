# Configuration

Approzium is configured through environment variables.

- `APPROZIUM_HOST`: Defaults to `"127.0.0.1"`.
- `APPROZIUM_HTTP_PORT`: Defaults to `"6000"`.
- `APPROZIUM_GRPC_PORT`: Defaults to `"6001"`.
- `APPROZIUM_LOG_LEVEL`: Defaults to `"info"`. Supported selections are `"trace"`, `"debug"`,
    `"info"`, `"warn"`, `"error"`, `"fatal"`, and `"panic"`. Upper case may be used.
- `APPROZIUM_LOG_FORMAT`: Defaults to `"text"`. Also supports `"json"`.
- `APPROZIUM_LOG_RAW`: Defaults to `"false"`, meaning that by default, Approzium's logs mask sensitive data.
    Setting to `"true"` activates raw logs, so no sensitive values will be masked. For example, if set to `"true"`,
    the AWS `signed_get_caller_identity` string will be fully included in logs, presenting an opportunity for
    a viewer to impersonate another. Should only be set to `"true"` in environments where logs are carefully
    guarded.
- `APPROZIUM_VAULT_TOKEN_PATH`: Optional, if set it will cause the latest Vault token to always
    be pulled from the given file.

Approzium supports Vault for storing database credentials. To use Vault, at a minimum, the `VAULT_ADDR`
must be set. Either the `VAULT_TOKEN` or `APPROZIUM_VAULT_TOKEN_PATH` must be set, with the `VAULT_TOKEN`
taking precedence. We recommend using the `APPROZIUM_VAULT_TOKEN_PATH` with the Vault agent, as described
[here](https://learn.hashicorp.com/vault/identity-access-management/vault-agent-aws), because that approach
will allow the Vault token to be refreshed by the Vault agent, rather than eventually expiring.

Additional Vault configuration is supported, as described
[here](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/commands#environment-variables).
