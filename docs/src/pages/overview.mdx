# Approzium
**Approzium** enables services to securely connect to databases without providing credentials.

Here's how you might typically connect to your database.
```python
from psycopg2 import connect

conn = connect("host=1.2.3.4 user=user1 password=verySecurePassword dbname=mydb")
```

Here's what it would look like with Approzium. ðŸ˜Ž
```python
from approzium import Authenticator
from approzium.psycopg2 import connect

auth = Authenticator('authenticator:6000')

# Look ma, no password!
conn = connect("host=1.2.3.4 user=user1 dbname=mydb", authenticator=auth)
```

You can get started with Approzium [here](/quickstart).
