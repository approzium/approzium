## Terraform 0.12 and Above

To speed you up, we offer stock Terraform configs for deploying the Approzium Authenticator. They live
[in our Github repo](https://github.com/cyralinc/approzium/tree/develop/terraform). We would also like
to add support for GCP and Azure, and we welcome community contributions.
