| --host             | APPROZIUM_HOST             | 127.0.0.1  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| --httpport         | APPROZIUM_HTTP_PORT        | 6000       | Port for HTTP(S) API endpoints.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| --grpcport         | APPROZIUM_GRPC_PORT        | 6001       | Port for authenticator endpoint for clients.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| --disabletls       | APPROZIUM_DISABLE_TLS      | false      | When false, Approzium comes up as an `"https"` server. When `"true"` disables TLS, and plain "http" is used. Setting to `"true"` means the Approzium authentication server will send database connection information in plain text, making it vulnerable to [man-in-the-middle attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack). **Do not set to `"true"` in production environments.** |
| --tlscertpath      | APPROZIUM_PATH_TO_TLS_CERT |            | The path to the TLS certificate the Approzium authentication server has been issued to prove its identity. Curious about how to generate a valid cert? See [this walkthrough](https://itnext.io/practical-guide-to-securing-grpc-connections-with-go-and-tls-part-1-f63058e9d6d1). This certificate would correspond to the `service.pem` generated in the walkthrough. However, ideally this would not be a certificate issued by your own [Certificate Authority (CA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_authority), and instead it might be issued by your company's internal CA and/or a widely recognized one. However, even a self-created CA is better than none. |
| --tlskeypath       | APPROZIUM_PATH_TO_TLS_KEY  |            | The path to the TLS key the Approzium authentication server can use to prove its identity. In the above walkthrough, this would correspond to the `service.key`.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| --loglevel         | APPROZIUM_LOG_LEVEL        | info       | Supported selections are "trace", "debug", "info", "warn", "error", "fatal", and "panic". Upper case may be used.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| --logformat        | APPROZIUM_LOG_FORMAT       | text       | Also supports "json".                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| --lograw           | APPROZIUM_LOG_RAW          | false      | Approzium's logs mask sensitive data. Setting to "true" activates raw logs, so no sensitive values will be masked. For example, if set to "true", the AWS signed_get_caller_identity string will be fully included in logs, presenting an opportunity for a viewer to impersonate another. Should only be set to "true" in environments where logs are carefully guarded. |
| --vaulttokenpath   | APPROZIUM_VAULT_TOKEN_PATH |            | Optional, if set it will cause the latest Vault token to always be pulled from the given file.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| --config           | APPROZIUM_CONFIG_FILE_PATH |            | Optional, set it to path containing a YAML config file called `approzium.config.yml`                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

Approzium uses the following precedence order. Each item takes precedence over the item below it:

 - command line flags
 - environment variables
 - config file
 - defaults

# Approzium Vault Backend

Approzium supports Vault for storing database credentials. To use Vault, at a minimum, the `VAULT_ADDR`
must be set. Either the `VAULT_TOKEN` or `APPROZIUM_VAULT_TOKEN_PATH` must be set, with the `VAULT_TOKEN`
taking precedence. We recommend using the `APPROZIUM_VAULT_TOKEN_PATH` with the Vault agent, as described
[here](https://learn.hashicorp.com/vault/identity-access-management/vault-agent-aws), because that approach
will allow the Vault token to be refreshed by the Vault agent, rather than eventually expiring.

Additional Vault configuration is supported, as described
[here](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/commands#environment-variables).
