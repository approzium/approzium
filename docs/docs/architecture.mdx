The Approzium platform consists of a number of different components:

* **application** - Cloud application that needs access to a database. It is running on a platform that provides cloud IAM services.
* **database** - the database that the service wants to connect to.
* **IAM Service** - IAM service provided by the cloud platform the service is using. It handles requests such as verifying the service's identity. For example, in AWS, this is called the [STS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/welcome.html).
* **Approzium authenticator** - Approzium service that interfaces with the Approzium SDK and with the secrets manager. This service verifies the service's identity, retrieves the credentials from the secrets manager, and calculates the authentication challenge response.

Here is the connection sequence for Approzium:
