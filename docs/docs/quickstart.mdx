This guide will show you how to:
- Deploy the Authenticator.
- Store database credentials in Vault to be retrieved by the Authenticator.
- Connect to a Postgres database through the Approzium Python SDK.

## Deploying the Authenticator
Get the Authenticator binary [here](https://github.com/approzium/approzium/tree/develop/authenticator), then run it with
the environment variables `VAULT_ADDR` and `VAULT_TOKEN` set. These are example values, in real life we'd expect Vault to
be run elsewhere.
```shell
export VAULT_ADDR=http://localhost:8200
export VAULT_TOKEN=root
./authenticator
```

For availability, we recommend running the Authenticator in a long-running environment (such as an EC2 instance) rather
than in a short-lived environment (like in AWS Lambda).

### Storing Credentials in Vault
The Authenticator expects credentials for a single database user as a secret stored against the database user as the key.
The secret contains the database password and a set of IAM roles allowed to access the credentials in the following structure.
```shell
cat dbuser1-creds.json
{
    "dbuser1": {
        "password": "asdfghjkl",
        "iam_arns": [
            "arn:aws:iam::accountid:role/rolename1",
            "arn:aws:iam::accountid:role/rolename2"
        ]
    }
}
```

For database access to be granted to a caller, the caller's exact `iam_arn` must be listed, _unless_ the caller has assumed a role.
For assumed roles, either the role ARN or the assumed role ARN may be used to grant access.

Enable Vault KV Version 1 (see [Vault documentation](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/secrets/kv/kv-v1) for more information).
```shell
vault secrets enable -path=approzium -version=1 kv
```

Put the secret at path `approzium/<DATABASE_HOST:DATABASE_PORT>` with your database user as the key.
```shell
vault write approzium/1.2.3.4:5432 @dbuser1-creds.json
```

## SDK Usage
Install the SDK in your client.
```shell
pip3 install approzium
```

Connect to your database as follows. (Note: TLS should **not** be disabled in production environments,
see [our Python guide](https://approzium.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#approzium.AuthClient) for how to configure them.)
```python
from approzium import AuthClient
from approzium.psycopg2 import connect

# create an Authenticator client
auth = AuthClient('authenticator:6001', disable_tls=True)

# connect using Approzium's connect method without providing a password
conn = connect("host=1.2.3.4 user=dbuser1 dbname=mydbhost", authenticator=auth)

# use the connection as you typically would. very cool!
cur = conn.cursor()
cur.execute('SELECT 1')
```
